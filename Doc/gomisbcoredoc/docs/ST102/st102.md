# MISB 0102 Security Metadata Local Sets

**Security Metadata Local Sets for Motion Imagery Data**

This standard defines a Security Metadata Universal Set and a Security Metadata Local Set
encoded as KLV (Key-Length-Value) elements for marking Motion Imagery Data with security
classification information.  

It is mandatory to include the Security Metadata Local set (as nested item) into MISB601 Local set.

## Encoding data

### Using predefined strings, as described in the standard
```js
{
    "1": "UNCLASSIFIED//",
    "2": "ISO_3166_TwoLetter",
    "3": "//IL",
    "4": "Impleo test flight",
    "5": "Test data set",
    "6": "Releasing Instructions Test",
    "7": "Classified By Impleo",
    "8": "Derived From test",
    "9": "Classification Test",
    "10": "20201021",
    "11": "Marking System",
    "12": "ISO_3166_TwoLetter",
    "13": "IL",
    "14": "Comments",
    "22": 9,
    "23": "2020-10-21",
    "24": "2020-10-21"
}
```
You can also use the integers instead. The result will be same (and work a little bit faster, as no conversion is needed)

```js
{
    "1": 1,
    "2": 1,
    "3": "//IL",
    "4": "Impleo test flight",
    "5": "Test data set",
    "6": "Releasing Instructions Test",
    "7": "Classified By Impleo",
    "8": "Derived From test",
    "9": "Classification Test",
    "10": "20201021",
    "11": "Marking System",
    "12": 1,
    "13": "IL",
    "14": "Comments",
    "22": 12,
    "23": "2020-10-21",
    "24": "2020-10-21"
}
```

> Note, in most cases, you should probably deal with the Security Metadata Local Set as a nested data and use a parent **MISB601** class instance, without dealing directly with **MISB102** library.  


To encode the MISB102 payload we need to create an instance of **MISB102** and pass the string to the **EncodePayload** method. Note, we're using **EncodePayload** and not **EncodePacket** as the results are used by the parent local set which assigns a **tag** (48, in case of MISB601) and uses the length of the encoded buffer as Klv length. 

```C#
MISB102 misb102 = new MISB102();
var buf = misb102.EncodePayload(pckt);
```

## Decoding data

> Note, Same as with encoding. In most cases, you should will deal with the Security Metadata Local Set as a nested data and use a parent **MISB601** class instance, without dealing directly with **MISB102** library.  

```C#
MISB102 misb102 = new MISB102();
var pckt = misb102.DecodePayload(buf);
```
